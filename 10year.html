		<div id="textThing">
			<p>In 10 years from now if I were to have a similar job to the one from the other assignment I would be making about 100k</p>

			<h2>Monthly Budget</h2>
			<h4>According to <a href="paycheckcity.com">PaycheckCity</a> I would take home about $5600 each month.</h4>
			<h3>Rent</h3>

			<p>$2400 of the $5600 would go to rent assuming I'm near San Francisco.</p>
			<h3>Student Loans</h3>
			<img src="money.png">
			<p>If in 10 years I have the average student loan debt it would be around $30000. That means I'd be paying about $600 a month if it was a 5 year loan.</p>
			<h3>Car Loan</h3>
			<img src="car.png">
			<p>A car loan might only be around $300 each month according to <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/auto/auto-loan-calculator.aspx">Bankrate</a> for a $15000 loan</p>
			<h3>Food</h3>
			<img src="apple.png">
			<p>As calculated before in the San Francisco area I'd have to spend about $400 a month on food.</p>
			<h3>Leftover</h3>
			<p>Of the 1900 remaining most of it would go towards some sort of savings while the rest of it would pay for stuff like cellphone bills and some entertainment.</p>
